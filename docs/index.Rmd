## Disclaimer

>- This is not the solution to all [coding] problems
>- It is merely another tool in your DataScience toolbox (albeit, a useful one!)

## Motivation: the problem

>- Coding is rarely linear
>- We often have to go back and change data, assumptions, transformations, filters, colors, font types
>- Projects can get really big really fast... and re-running an entire Rmd file is not an option (well, kinda)
>- We rarely work alone (new data, new approaches, new questions...)

## Motivation: an example

We'll simulate everyone's nightmare:

>- You have built your "coding pipeline" and are ready to do something with it
>- Then, you (or a colleague) finds an error in the raw data (crisis!!!)
>- You fix the error, and now have to rerun the ENTIRE analysis. Chaos:
  >- _which script did what, again?_
  >- _What depended on what?_
>- By the time you are done figuring this out, you've also gotten your hands on more data so... gotta re-run everything again

# [Self-]Motivation:

> ~~The solution lies in the problem~~ -> The problem lies in the solution

# {data-background="motivation.png"}

## Consider a case

```{bash, eval = F}
data
    |_raw_data.csv
    |_clean_data.csv
scripts
    |_clean_data.R
    |_plot_data.R
results
    |_figure1.png
```

## A potential solution: `lapply`

```{r, eval = F}
# Identify all scripts
scripts <- list.files(path = "scripts",
                      pattern = "*.R")

# Run them all
lapply(scripts, source)
```


## A potential solution: `purrr` + `furrr`

```{r, eval = F}
# Identify all scripts
scripts <- list.files(path = "scripts",
                      pattern = "*.R")

# Run them all... in parallel
plan(multisession, workers = 4) # Use for cores
future_walk(scripts, source)    # Walk through files
```

```{r, out.width="40%", echo = F, fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("doge.png")
```

## A potential solution: `run_all.R`

Have a script:

```{r, eval = F}
# Run all scripts
# This script runs all the code in my project, from scratch
source("scripts/clean_data.R")      # To clean the data
source("scripts/plot_data.R")       # To plot the data
```

And either call `source(run_all.R)` or manually source the ones that we *think* we need to run.

## Problems with these

- Do I even need to actually run all?

- What if variables / values are left in my environment?

- It worked when I wrote it, but not anymore

- What if the timing isn't correct?

## Existing solutions

### Many R packages

>- [drake](https://books.ropensci.org/drake/)

>- [targets](https://docs.ropensci.org/targets/)

>- Many, many, many other great solutions...

## Existing solutions

### But some shortcommings

>- R-specific (hinders collaboration)
>- Things keep changing (for better, but still)

## Existing solutions

### But some shortcommings

- R-specific (hinders collaboration)
- Things keep changing (for better, but still)

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("changes.png")
```

>- They really are just leveraging an existing infrastructure

# Enter `make`

## Overview of `make` and `Makefile`

## How does it work?

## Targets and prerequisites

# Quick example

## Recall our previous case:

```{bash, eval = F}
data
    |_raw_data.csv
    |_clean_data.csv
scripts
    |_clean_data.R
    |_plot_data.R
results
    |_figure1.png
```

## The `Makefile` would simply be:

```{bash, eval = F}
target: prerequisites
  how do I build them?

results/figure1.png: scripts/plot_data.R data/clean_data.csv
  Rscript scripts/plot_data.R

data/clean_data.csv: scripts/clean_data.R data/raw_data.csv
  Rscript scripts/clean_data.R
```

And one command does it all: `make`


## Today's project

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align="center", echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("../workflow.png")
```

The repo is here: [https://github.com/jcvdav/make_tutorial](https://github.com/jcvdav/make_tutorial)

## Today's project

Walk you around the repo and set things up

Goals:

>- Show you how to `make` your project
- Simulate getting a "fixed" version of the data and re-`make`ing the project
- Simulate getting NEW (or more?) data and re-`make`int the project once again
- Finally, create you own code and add a pair of target / prerequisites
- If we have time, we'll generalize some of the code (less typing!)
